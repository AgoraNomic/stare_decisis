This is an informal description/FAQ of Agoran common law (CFJ history) as it impacts current play.
These are not legally binding on judges but provide guidance for how past decisions have gone.

# Conditional actions

Prior to the adoption of P8925, performing a by-announcement action
conditionally was not explicitly mentioned in the Rules.  It was governed by
this clause in Rule 478/40 (Fora):
>      Where the rules define an action that a person CAN perform "by
>      announcement", that person performs that action by, in a single
>      public message, specifying the action and setting forth intent to
>      perform that action by sending that message, doing both clearly
>      and unambiguously.

Under the old common law standard, a condition ("If X is true, I do Y") was
considered to set forth intent to perform the action if true and not otherwise,
if and only if the condition specified is determinable, with reasonable effort
by a "typical" Agoran, at the time the action is attempted.  In particular,
attempts at paradox ("If this sentence is false, I do Y") were just considered
unclear and do nothing, rather than actually creating a paradox.

[P8925](https://www.mail-archive.com/agora-official@agoranomic.org/msg13104.html)
attempted to codify this standard in R2518/1:
>     A communication purporting to express conditional intent to
>     perform an action is considered unclear and ambiguous unless, at a
>     minimum, the conditional is determinate, true, and reasonably
>     straightforward to evaluate with publicly-available information at
>     the time of communication. The communicator SHOULD explain
>     specific reasons for being uncertain of the outcome when e makes
>     the communication.

It is important to note the phrasing of "unclear and ambiguous unless, at a
minimum". This implies both that the conditional should be presumed to be
invalid unless the listed requirements can be affirmatively shown to be meant,
and that it does not explicitly preclude other standards from being applied.

# Tabled Actions

Formerly: Dependent actions

Intents to perform tabled actions must meet the following requirements (R1728/46):
>     A person, acting as emself, CAN by announcement table an intent
>     (syn.  "intend") to perform a tabled action, clearly,
>     conspicuously, explicitly, and without obfuscation specifying the
>     action, the method (including non-default parameter values), and,
>     optionally, conditions.

The governing precedent for "conspicuously" and "without obfuscation" is
[CFJ3747](http://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/3747) (written during a prior, but
similar, wording of the relevant rules).

CFJ3747 defines something as conspicuous if "a reasonable player would be able to tell
after glancing at a message that it contains the dependent action" (para. 3 of
the judgement). See the judgement for further details.

CFJ3747 defines "without obfuscation" using a two part test:
1. "[A] reasonable Agoran reading the message must, at a glance, be able to
   understand the gist of the dependent action being announced".
2. The details of the action must be "easy to understand" (with a guideline of 30-60
   seconds maximum).

CFJ3747 does not take an opinion on what it means for intents to be "clear", asserting that
remaining precedent is clear.

CFJ3747 does not take an opinon on "explicitly", as that language did not exist at the time.
