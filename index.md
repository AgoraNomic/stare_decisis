# Conditional actions

With the exception of Conditional Votes (Rule 2127/11), performing a by-announcement action
conditionally is not explicitly mentioned in the Rules.  It is governed by this clause in 
Rule 478/40 (Fora):
>      Where the rules define an action that a person CAN perform "by
>      announcement", that person performs that action by, in a single
>      public message, specifying the action and setting forth intent to
>      perform that action by sending that message, doing both clearly
>      and unambiguously.

A condition ("If X is true, I do Y") is considered to set forth intent to perform the action
if true and not otherwise, if and only if the condition specified is determinable, with
reasonable effort by a "typical" Agoran, at the time the action is attempted.  In particular,
attempts at paradox ("If this sentence is false, I do Y") are just considered unclear and
do nothing, rather than actually creating a paradox.  (CFJ References)
